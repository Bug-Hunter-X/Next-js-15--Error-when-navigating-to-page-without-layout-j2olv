# Next.js 15 Layout Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where navigating to a page without an explicitly defined layout can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  The error message may not always be clear, making debugging more challenging.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file lacks a layout definition. When navigating to this page, Next.js might throw an error or render the page incorrectly, depending on the overall app structure.

## Solution

The solution is to explicitly define a layout for the `pages/about.js` file, either by using the `app` directory structure or by defining a custom layout within the `pages` directory. For simplicity, this example uses the `app` directory which is preferred in Next.js 13 and above.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should encounter an error or unexpected behavior if the layout is not correctly defined.
